	longDescr = "Where's the old FL-T200 Fuel Tank?" you might ask. Not to worry, you can bring it back from the dead with this simple patch. Will generate a copy with updated title and description. As a bonus, it will also generate a copy of the FL-T500 fuel tank at no additional cost! It's an incredible offer!
