	@description = The T200 tank had some difficulty being accepted in the spacecraft engineering world, because most rocket builders had trouble overcoming their urges to squee at the "cute little fuel tank". This initial reaction was only put aside when the amount of fiery explosions in assembly areas became so high, strict guidelines were put in place to prohibit "teasing the fuel containers". The T200 Tank now is widely used in several space programs, especially in conjunction with the LV-909 engine. Model courtesy of KHI. Replaced by a newer model in KSP 0.18 in December 2012.

	@description = The FL series was received as a substantial upgrade over previous fuel containers used in the Space Program, generally due to its ability to keep the fuel unexploded more often than not. Fuel tanks are useless if there isn't a Liquid Engine attached under it. They can also be stacked with other fuel tanks to increase the amount of fuel for the engine below. Model courtesy of KHI. Replaced by a newer model in KSP 0.18 in December 2012.
