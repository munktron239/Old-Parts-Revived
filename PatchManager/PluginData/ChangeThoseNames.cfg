	@description = A highly advanced turbine engine using space-grade materials for very high performance. This new model features the latest in thrust vectoring and compression technology. This engine is designed to operate best at higher altitudes and speeds, and engineers from C7 Aerospace assured us all those leaks stop once it gets up there. Replaced by a newer model in KSP 1.0.5 in November 2015.

	@description = After an intensive search for an engineer crazy enough to plan and build a revolutionary new engine type, researchers stumbled across Eugene Kerman - or, as he's known by night... THE CONSTRUCTOR! He failed miserably, and this is what we got instead. Replaced by a newer model in KSP 1.0.5 in November 2015.
